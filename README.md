Technologies 

 - React
 	- I used React to show proficiency in a modern framework and general component architecture. Supplemented React with react-router-dom to allow linking/unique paging. 
 -	Travis CI
	- For easy deployment to Netlify.
 -	Eslint
	 -	A basic linting tool to reinforce consistent formatting.
 -	Babel
	 -	Used to make the application backwards compatible with previous versions of JS. 
 -	Webpack
	 -	A standard bundling/build tool to build and deploy the application.
 -	Jest/Enzyme
	 -	Testing libraries to test that React components will render properly given a set of props. 
 -	Normalize
	 -	Remove built in browser CSS.
